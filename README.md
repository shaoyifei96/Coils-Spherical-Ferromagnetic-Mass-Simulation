## What are we trying to do?
We are trying to treat __cancer__. By modeling electromagnets accurately and exploring new arrangement of magnets for max field gradient, but minimum strength, we can apply electromagnets near people to treat AOM and COME without exposing people to excessive magnetic field. 

## Library Used 
- __[link](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53071-magnetic-fields-of-solenoids-magnets)__ Magnetic fields of solenoids/magnets
version 1.4.0.0 (2.74 KB) by David CEBRON (may be improved if using the official version of elliptical integral)
- __[link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29632430/quiver3-arrow-color-corresponding-to-magnitude)__ - colored quiver solution proposed by Suever
